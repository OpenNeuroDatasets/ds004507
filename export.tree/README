#Spinal Cord Head Position MRI

This MRI dataset for the PMJ-based CSA project. 
The analysis pipeline is available within the GitHub repository: https://github.com/sct-pipeline/pmj-based-csa

## Dataset structure
The MRI dataset contains MRIs from 10 healthy participants with 3 different neck positions: felxion, neutral and extension. 
The following images are included:
- T2w sagittal isotropic 0.6 mm

Three sessions:

- ses-headDown --> flexion
- ses-headNormal --> neutral
- ses-headUp --> extension
Note: sub-002 has different acqusisition parameters: 0.7 mm isotropic for ses-headDown and ses-headUp
